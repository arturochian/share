Enclosed please find Vol.\ 3/2 of The R Journal, ISSN: 2073-4859. Note that this is a
print copy of the electronic journal, published at \\
{\centering{\verb+http://journal.r-project.org/+}}.

This is the fourth consecutive issue that we have sent upon publication for
evaluation. As you have confirmed that the evaluation process is still
underway we will continue to submit issues as they are published until we hear
further from you.

Note that my tenure as Editor-in-Chief will cease at the end of 2011, after
which Martyn Plummer (Martyn.Plummer@R-project.org) will take over the role. Either of
us will be happy to answer any queries you may have.

\closing{Sincerely}
