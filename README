Directory 'share' contains lots of useful stuff, including

  Rnews.dtx	LaTeX source for generating code and documentation for
		Rnews.sty (happens automatically).
		
  Rnews.bib	The .bib database with entries for all "regular"
		articles as well as the help desk and programmers' niche
		columns.

and the following scripts:

  news2ltx.pl	Use on the R NEWS file as a first approximation of the
		changes-R column.
		
  pkg2ltx.pl	Use on the .tar.gz source files of the "new" CRAN
		packages as a first approximation of the changes-CRAN
		column.  The list of new packages needs to be queried
		from Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org, and added to
		changes-CRAN.dat.
		
  toc2bib.pl	Use on the respective Rnews_$year-$number files for a
		first approximation of the additional .bib entries for
		Rnews.bib. (In my experience this is very imperfect, omitting articles;
		check carefully! JF)
