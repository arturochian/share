 *  we want to change the name to something more `serious', 
    tentativelly `The R Journal' (-> post a RFC to r-devel <PM>)

    The journal might have a section `R News'. Maybe having `Regular
    Articles' and `Short Communications' (the latter only editor-reviewed),  
    `White Papers' (more technical
    documentation, e.g., Brian's and Paul's paper on internationalization,
    i.e., documenting features in _base_ R). Featured articles (with
    dicussions)? Book reviews. Columns (R Help Desk, Programmers Niche). 
    News (conference announcements).

    We still want to offer a platform for R News alike papers. 

 *  conflicts with JSS? No, because we focus only on the R community.
    Different writing styles. Authors can assume the reader to know R very well.

 *  change in layout: switch to one-column layout (portrait) or stay
    two-column (landscape)? -> give it a try <PM>

 *  guidelines for authors / editors:

    - guidelines for authors send to reviewers as well (draft: <JF>)

    - checklist for reviewers and editors (draft: <JF>)

    - encourage use of Sweave much more stronger

    - provide data and code (if possible)

    - guidelines for book reviews

    - start with guidelines for editors based on share/README (<JF>)

 *  book reviews: semi-automated procedure? Coordinate with JSS?

 *  software reviews? Reviews on packages? Reply by package authors? Not
    now, maybe later. Not the TAS-way.

 *  set up a list of interesting `useR! 2006' contributions <TH>

 *  Kurt: send out information on R News whenever a package is uploaded to
    CRAN. Policy? Selection procedure? Cc package uploads to rnews-editors.
    (and so some list of CRAN task view maintainers). RSS feeds?

 *  Editorial board member 2007. Vince Carey, Tim Hesterberg, Marc Schwarz,
    Patrick Burns.
    France / Spain / Brazil / Africa / Japan? Students of ?

    Ask R Foundation <PM>!

 *  indexing: Searchable contents 
    (google site search, ask Duncan Murdoch -> <PM>). 
    CIS? Bibtex-database?
