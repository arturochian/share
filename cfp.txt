R News: Call for Papers

Dear useRs and developeRs,

the next issue of `R News' is scheduled for the beginning of May 
and we are now  accepting submissions for this first issue in 2005. 
For more information see

      http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/

If you are the author of a package on CRAN and you would like to promote
it a little bit, or if you simply have an interesting application using
R, we hope you can find some time to write a short article on it. We
suggest that it be approximately 3 pages or less. The idea of the
newsletter is that it be interesting to R users without being too
technical. For example an article describing a package could begin by
briefly outlining the statistical background and go on to demonstrate
the usage on some typical data set. Of course graphics are more than
welcome!

Bill Venables <Bill.Venables@csiro.au> is also encouraging submissions 
to the more specialist Programmer's Niche column. In this case the 
technical level could be a little higher, of course, but not necessarily: 
ingeniousness is the key.

The R Help Desk column is intended to present answers to frequently
asked questions as well as tricks that are useful to the majority of 
useRs. Please send submissions to Uwe Ligges <Uwe.Ligges@R-project.org>.

The deadline for submissions is 

	April, 10th, 2005

Keep the contributions rolling in!

The Editorial Board, 

Doug Bates, Paul Murrell and Torsten Hothorn
