This is an experimental modified version of RJournal.sty with a
single-column format. To avoid confusion, it has been renamed.  Once
tested, it should replace the standard Rjournal.sty.

Note that figures and tables are now properly floating. The style file
now uses the placeins latex package to stop badly placed floats from
appearing above the article title or, worse, drifting off to the end
of the issue. NB that it will be useful to add the command

\FloatBarrier

(from the placeins package) *before* the bibliography of each article,
to stop floats appearing after the bibliography and author
affiliations.
