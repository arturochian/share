Dear Package Maintainer,

thank you for participating in the R project for statistical computing by
submitting a package to CRAN. We would like to call your attention to two
ways of advertising the functionality of your package to the R user
community.

A special email list `R-packages' is available for short messages about
new or updated packages. Messages are automatically forwarded to the
`R-help' list. See

	http://www.R-project.org/mail.html
 
for further information.

A more detailed description of a package may be published in R News, the
newsletter of the R project. R News aims at publishing short to medium
length articles illustrating the practical application of functionality 
provided in packages. R News is online available from

	http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/Rnews/

For further information, please feel free to contact the editors under
<Rnews-editors@r-project.org>.
 
We are looking forward to your informations on `R-packages' and your 
submission to R News,


Douglas Bates, 
R News, Editor-in-Chief
